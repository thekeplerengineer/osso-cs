Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your GitHub username and repository name respectively. This setup makes use of:

- Shields and badges for better visibility and presentation.
- Emoticons for improved readability and appeal.
- Description for each course and an indicator to show whether the course is completed, in progress, or planned.

This format is easy to maintain, clean, and offers readers an organized way to browse through your content. You can also add more sections or badges as per your needs.
